This project is a full RESTful API built using **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and **Mongoose**. The API provides the ability to perform CRUD operations on data stored in a MongoDB database.

### Features

- Full CRUD functionality for managing resources
- MongoDB as the database to store data
- Mongoose for modeling the data and interacting with MongoDB
- Express.js for building routes and handling requests
- Node.js for the backend server

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side code
- **Express.js**: Web framework for handling routes and middleware
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing data
- **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB
- **Postman** (or CLI tools like curl): For testing API requests
